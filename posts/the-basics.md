## Introduction to Web Development

Web development refers to the creation and maintenance of websites. It involves a range of activities from building simple static pages to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.

### Types of Web Development
1. **Front-End Development**: Focuses on the visual aspects of a website, such as layout, design, and interactivity. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. **Back-End Development**: Focuses on the server-side, managing data, and server logic. It uses languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, and frameworks like Node.js.
3. **Full-Stack Development**: Involves both front-end and back-end development.


## Basic Concepts in Computer Science

Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems. It involves understanding the principles and use of computers in problem-solving.

### Key Concepts

1. **Algorithms and Data Structures**: 
   - **Algorithms**: Step-by-step procedures for calculations. They are essential for solving problems efficiently.
   - **Data Structures**: Ways to store and organize data to enable efficient access and modification. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

2. **Programming Languages**:
   - **High-Level Languages**: These are more abstract and closer to human languages, making them easier to learn and use. Examples include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript.
   - **Low-Level Languages**: These are closer to machine code and provide greater control over hardware. Examples include assembly language.

3. **Complexity and Computability**:
   - **Big O Notation**: A way to describe the efficiency of algorithms, focusing on their time and space requirements in the worst-case scenario.
   - **P vs NP Problem**: A major unsolved problem in computer science concerning the time it takes to solve a problem versus the time it takes to verify a solution.

4. **Software Development**:
   - **Software Engineering**: The application of engineering principles to software development to ensure reliability and efficiency. It includes methodologies like Agile, Scrum, and DevOps.
   - **Version Control Systems**: Tools that help manage changes to source code over time. Git is a popular version control system.

5. **Operating Systems and Networking**:
   - **Operating Systems (OS)**: Software that manages hardware resources and provides services for computer programs. Examples include Windows, macOS, and Linux.
   - **Networking**: The practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources. Key concepts include TCP/IP, DNS, and routing.

6. **Databases**:
   - **Relational Databases**: Use tables to store data and SQL (Structured Query Language) for data manipulation. Examples include MySQL and PostgreSQL.
   - **NoSQL Databases**: Use various data models, such as document, key-value, graph, or column-family. Examples include MongoDB and Cassandra.

### Example: Basic Algorithm - Binary Search

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item until the possible locations are reduced to one.

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return -1

# Example usage
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
target = 7
result = binary_search(arr, target)
print("Index of target is:", result)  # Output: Index of target is: 3
```

### Example: Basic Data Structure - Stack

A stack is a collection of elements with two principal operations:
- **Push**: Adds an element to the collection.
- **Pop**: Removes the most recently added element.

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
        return None

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]
        return None

# Example usage
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
stack.push(3)
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 3
print(stack.peek())  # Output: 2
```

This section provides a foundational overview of key concepts in computer science, focusing on algorithms, data structures, programming languages, software development, operating systems, networking, and databases.

### Software
1. **Operating System (OS)**: The software that supports a computer's basic functions, like Windows, macOS, or Linux.
2. **Applications**: Programs designed for end-users, such as web browsers, word processors, and games.

## How the Internet Works

The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate via a standardized set of protocols.

### Key Concepts
1. **IP Address**: A unique string of numbers separated by periods that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.
2. **Domain Name System (DNS)**: Translates domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses.
3. **HTTP/HTTPS**: Protocols used for transferring hypertext requests and information on the internet. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP.
4. **Routers and Switches**: Devices that forward data packets between computer networks.
5. **Servers**: Computers that provide data or services to other computers over the internet.

### How Data Travels on the Internet
1. **Client Request**: A user types a URL into a browser, which sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address.
2. **Routing**: The request travels through a series of routers to reach the target server.
3. **Server Response**: The server processes the request and sends back the appropriate data, such as an HTML page.
4. **Rendering**: The browser renders the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the web page to the user.

## Key Technologies in Web Development

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
The standard language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
A stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML.

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

h1 {
    color: #333;
}

p {
    color: #666;
}
```

### JavaScript
A programming language that enables interactive web pages. It is an essential part of web applications.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const heading = document.querySelector('h1');
    heading.addEventListener('click', () => {
        alert('Hello, World!');
    });
});
```

### Web Development Frameworks
1. **Front-End**: React, Angular, Vue.js
2. **Back-End**: Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails

## Simple Web Development Example

Here is a simple example of a web page that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### index.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Simple Web Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Click the button to change the text</h1>
    <button id="changeTextBtn">Change Text</button>
    <p id="text">This is the original text.</p>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### styles.css

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    margin-top: 50px;
}

h1 {
    color: #333;
}

button {
    padding: 10px 20px;
    margin-top: 20px;
    cursor: pointer;
}

p {
    margin-top: 20px;
    color: #666;
}
```

### script.js

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const button = document.getElementById('changeTextBtn');
    const text = document.getElementById('text');
    
    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
        text.textContent = 'The text has been changed!';
    });
});
```
