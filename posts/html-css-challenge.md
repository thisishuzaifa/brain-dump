# HTML CSS Challenge

## Choose one of the following challenges:

### Challenge 1:Create a tribute page

Choose a historical figure who’s meaningful to you and create a webpage dedicated to them. The webpage should include:

    1. A title or heading with the person’s name
    2. An image of the person
    3. A caption for the image
    4. A timeline of the person’s life in the form of a list

This can be completed with only HTML, but use CSS to give it some style.


### Challenge 2: Create a Survey Form

HTML forms are an important part of many websites. Create a form for a survey on the topic of your choice.

Include a variety of answer options, including text fields, dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a submit button. Don’t forget to add a title, and consider using CSS to improve the look of your form.
