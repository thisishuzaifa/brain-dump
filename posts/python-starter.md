## Introduction to Python

### What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

### Why Learn Python?

- **Ease of Learning**: Python's simple syntax makes it an ideal language for beginners.
- **Versatility**: Python is used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
- **Large Community**: Python has a vast and active community, providing plenty of resources and support for learners.

### Installing Python

To start programming in Python, you need to install it on your computer. Follow these steps to install Python:

1. **Download Python**: Visit the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version for your operating system.
2. **Install Python**: Run the downloaded installer and follow the instructions. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".

After installation, open a terminal or command prompt and type `python --version` to verify the installation.

## Python Basics

### Variables and Data Types

In Python, you can store data in variables. Here are some basic data types:

- **Integers**: Whole numbers, e.g., `10`
- **Floats**: Decimal numbers, e.g., `3.14`
- **Strings**: Text, e.g., `"Hello, World!"`
- **Booleans**: True or False values, e.g., `True`

**Example:**
```python
age = 25            # Integer
height = 5.9        # Float
name = "Alice"      # String
is_student = True   # Boolean

print(age, height, name, is_student)

```

### Operators

Python supports various operators for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.

**Example:**
```python
# Arithmetic Operators
x = 10
y = 3
print(x + y)   # Addition
print(x - y)   # Subtraction
print(x * y)   # Multiplication
print(x / y)   # Division
print(x % y)   # Modulus

# Comparison Operators
print(x > y)   # Greater than
print(x < y)   # Less than
print(x == y)  # Equal to

# Logical Operators
print(x > 5 and y < 5)  # Logical AND
print(x > 5 or y < 1)   # Logical OR
print(not (x > 5))      # Logical NOT

```

### Control Flow

Control flow statements allow you to control the execution of your code based on conditions.

**Example:**
```python
# If-Else Statement
num = 7
if num > 5:
    print("Greater than 5")
else:
    print("Less than or equal to 5")

# For Loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While Loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

```

### Functions

Functions allow you to encapsulate code into reusable blocks.

**Example:**
```python
# Function Definition
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Function Call
greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")

```

## Python Libraries

### Introduction to Libraries

Python libraries are collections of pre-written code that you can use to perform common tasks. Some popular libraries include:

- **NumPy**: For numerical computing
- **Pandas**: For data analysis
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests

### Using Libraries

To use a library, you need to import it in your script.

**Example:**
```python
# Importing the math library
import math

# Using a function from the math library
result = math.sqrt(16)
print(result)  # Output: 4.0

```

## Small Project: Simple Calculator

### Project Overview

In this project, we will create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Define the Functions**: Create functions for each arithmetic operation.
2. **Take User Input**: Prompt the user to enter two numbers and an operation.
3. **Perform the Calculation**: Call the appropriate function based on the user's input.
4. **Display the Result**: Show the result of the calculation.

### Project Code

```python
# Step 1: Define the Functions
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

def divide(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return "Error! Division by zero."
    else:
        return x / y

# Step 2: Take User Input
print("Select operation:")
print("1. Add")
print("2. Subtract")
print("3. Multiply")
print("4. Divide")

choice = input("Enter choice (1/2/3/4): ")

num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Step 3: Perform the Calculation
if choice == '1':
    result = add(num1, num2)
elif choice == '2':
    result = subtract(num1, num2)
elif choice == '3':
    result = multiply(num1, num2)
elif choice == '4':
    result = divide(num1, num2)
else:
    result = "Invalid input!"

# Step 4: Display the Result
print(f"The result is: {result}")

```
