# Javascript Assignment

## 1. Create a function that takes 3 arguments and returns the sum of the these arguments.

## 2. FizzBuzz Challenge 

Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Fizz", for multiples of 5 print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

## 3. Solve the following problems:



**index.html:**
Create an HTML page named "`index.html`" to show off and combine what we have covered during this time.

**alphabet.html:**
If the text in the textbox has the word "alphabet" in it, then loop through the letters backwards from `z` to `a` and append images of the letters to the document; each letter must be 40px wide. Whenever a letter is clicked, all the images on the document get that letter's `src`.

Find the letters images in Discord.
