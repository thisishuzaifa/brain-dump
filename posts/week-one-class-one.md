# Basics of the Web, Programming, and JavaScript

## What happens when you type a URL in the browser?

When you type a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in the browser's address bar, several steps are involved in retrieving and displaying the web page associated with that URL. Here's a breakdown of what happens:

1. **Parsing the URL**: The browser parses the URL into different components, such as the protocol (e.g., "http://" or "https://"), the domain name (e.g., "www.example.com"), and the specific path or resource on the server.

2. **DNS Lookup**: The browser checks its local cache for the IP address associated with the domain name. If not found, it sends a DNS (Domain Name System) request to a DNS server to obtain the IP address of the server hosting the website.

3. **Establishing a Connection**: Using the obtained IP address, the browser establishes a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the web server on the specified port (usually port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS).

4. **HTTP Request**: The browser sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the server, including the requested resource (path) and additional headers, such as cookies or user-agent information.

5. **Server Processing**: The web server receives the HTTP request, processes it, and generates an appropriate response. This may involve accessing databases, executing scripts, or fetching additional resources.

6. **HTTP Response**: The server sends an HTTP response back to the browser, which includes a status code (indicating success or failure), response headers (containing metadata about the response), and the requested content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) if successful.

7. **Rendering the Web Page**: The browser receives the response and begins rendering the web page. It parses the HTML to construct the Document Object Model (DOM), applies CSS stylesheets to create the visual layout, and executes JavaScript code to add interactivity and dynamic content.

8. **Additional Resource Retrieval**: As the browser processes the HTML and CSS, it may encounter references to external resources like images, scripts, or stylesheets. It sends separate HTTP requests to fetch each of these resources from the server.

9. **Displaying the Web Page**: Once all resources are retrieved and the web page is fully rendered, the browser displays it in the user interface, allowing you to interact with the website's content, navigate through links, and perform various actions.

Overall, the process of typing a URL in the browser involves translating the URL into an IP address, establishing a connection with the server, exchanging HTTP requests and responses, and rendering the web page for the user to access and explore.


## What is a client-server architecture? How does it work?

A client-server architecture is a distributed computing model in which client and server processes communicate with each other over a network. The client is a process that requests data or services from the server, while the server is a process that provides data or services to the client. The client and server processes may run on the same computer or different computers connected via a network.

In a client-server architecture, the client and server processes are separate and independent. They can run on different computers, use different programming languages, and be developed by different teams. This allows for greater flexibility and scalability, as the client and server processes can be scaled independently to meet changing demands.

The client-server architecture is commonly used in web applications, where the client is a web browser and the server is a web server. The client sends HTTP requests to the server, which responds with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources. The client then renders the web page and allows the user to interact with it.


## JavaScript - the language of the web.

JavaScript is a programming language that is used to create interactive web pages. It is a client-side scripting language that runs in the browser and can be used to add dynamic content, validate forms, and create animations.

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted language that is dynamically typed and supports object-oriented programming. It is a multi-paradigm language that supports functional, imperative, and declarative programming styles.
